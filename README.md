# Decentralized Bet App

A decentralized betting game application using Solidity Smart contract and ERC20 token.

## Description

This project demonstrates a real-life example of an Ethereum network application. It uses an ERC20 token and a Smart contract to establish betting logic using the token.

## Features

- **Decentralized Betting**: Users can place bets in a decentralized manner using the ERC20 token.
- **Solidity Smart Contracts**: Utilizes Solidity for creating and managing smart contracts.
- **ERC20 Token**: Integration with ERC20 token standard for betting transactions.

## Installation

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/daltonnyx/decentralized-bet-app.git
    cd decentralized-bet-app
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    ```shell
    npm install
    ```

3. **Compile the Smart Contracts**:
    ```shell
    npx hardhat compile
    ```

4. **Deploy the Smart Contracts**:
    ```shell
    npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <network-name>
    ```

## Usage

After deploying the smart contracts, you can interact with them using the provided scripts or a front-end application.
